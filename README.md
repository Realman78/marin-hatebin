Website is up and running here: https://md-paster.herokuapp.com/  
Pastebin simplified to it's bare minimum for max efficiency and least time consumption.  
You type/paste text into the area, hit save, and your text is now accessible through a unique url for anyone with that url.  
This is mainly used for copying code snippets while discussing problems in some public rooms so you can avoid code mess.  
TODO: accounts so that you can see all your pastes && connect with socket.io for realtime change views
